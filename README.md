ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ftfmtavares

After a diverse series of professional experiences tending to management roles, I finally realized that what I really want to do is SW programming.

I always felt to be a natural software programmer ever since I started playing around with a 48K ZX Spectrum whilw I was a kid. I had a few good initial years as a professional SW developer but now I'm looking for to catch up with the latest software programming languages, frameworks and architectures.

Iâ€™m currently learning GO and I'm sharing here all my personal work
